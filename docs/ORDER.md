# Compilation-unit order

MSVC emits functions in source order, and the linker concatenates object files
in command-line order. Address order is therefore the primary evidence for
source ownership and link order.

`src/map` is now the address-sorted inventory of the 1,235 source functions
with a mapped WC2 destination. The 243 unresolved functions are omitted until
their destinations are established.

The physical source and object order still preserves the WC1 reconstruction
while WC2 compilation-unit ownership is recovered. Do not mechanically reorder
the files from low-confidence transfer rows: `make sort` is expected to report
out-of-order WC2 labels during this migration. The sections below record the
historical WC1 boundaries as provenance, not current WC2 placement claims.

## Proven WC2 boundaries

| Reconstructed source | Range | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/dibtime.cpp` | `0x0045CCB0`-`0x0045CD2B` | Two scalar dynamic initializer pairs referenced by consecutive `CRT$XCU` entries; immediately precedes `ThrottleFrameAndDrawFps` |

The timing unit is linked between `src/music.c` and `src/screen.c`, matching
the target sequence from `AllocateViewport` through the initializers to the
frame throttle.

## Historical WC1 image layout

```text
0x00401000  game core and Win32 support (mostly C; boundaries provisional)
0x004426A0  ix_log_printf (C++; owning object boundary unproven)
0x00442750  ix audio object sequence (C++; boundaries exact)
0x004492E0  MSVC 4.20 static debug CRT (not reconstructed)
```

The final core function before `ix_log_printf` starts at `0x00442600`. The
first CRT `__FILE__` anchor is at `0x004492E0`; the final `ix` routine occupies
the preceding range.

## Historical WC1 `ix` library order

Live assertion `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` strings fix these object boundaries
and their link order:

| Order | Range | Reconstructed source |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | `0x00442750`–`0x00443DA5` | `src/ix/streamer.cpp` |
| 2 | `0x00443DA6`–`0x0044490F` | `src/ix/thread.cpp` |
| 3 | `0x00444910`–`0x004451B4` | `src/ix/dsp.cpp` |
| 4 | `0x004451B5`–`0x00445F5F` | `src/ix/dsps.cpp` |
| 5 | `0x00445F60`–`0x004467C4` | `src/ix/mixer.cpp` |
| 6 | `0x004467C5`–`0x004471FF` | `src/ix/dspv.cpp` |
| 7 | `0x00447200`–`0x00447CD7` | `src/ix/system.cpp` |
| 8 | `0x00447CD8`–`0x0044879B` | `src/ix/sound.cpp` |
| 9 | `0x0044879C`–`0x004492DF` | `src/ix/sample.cpp` |

`src/ix/ixlog.cpp` contains `ix_log_printf` at `0x004426A0`. It is linked
immediately before the exact sequence above, but its original object extent is
not yet established.

## Historical WC1 game-core working split

The core is grouped into short subsystem-named files following address order.
The windows below are placement guides, not claims that every edge is an
original object boundary. A nested source unit can be proven even when its
containing file boundary remains provisional.

`src/globals.c` is temporary storage for globals whose original owner or
declaration order is not yet proven. It is not an original compilation unit.

## Strong boundary anchors

- `src/pload.c` identifies itself through the string
  `Library\Source\Pload.c PacketLoad`.
- WC2 adds `ShutdownNearHeap` at `0x00420B12` directly between
  `InitializeNearHeap` and `AllocateNearHeapBlockFromEnd`; its seven globals
  are the same private band used by the surrounding near-heap routines in
  `src/nav.c`.
- `LoadSpaceflightResources` is at `0x0045C35C`, between the direction-view
  setup and music initialization in `src/logic.c`. Its three `LoadShapeSet`
  calls, chained debris-shape assignments, and `LoadOriginFxDrivers` caller
  disprove the earlier low-confidence `0x00420B12` transfer.
- `src/dib.c` and `src/music.c` identify their routines in diagnostics.
- The debug overlay's constructor, destructor, ECX methods, and allocation
  sites prove `src/debug.cpp` as a C++ unit.
- Macintosh symbols establish the nested `auto`, `fl`, `brain`, `logic`,
  `targ`, `select`, and `smart` runs after their Win32 bodies are checked.
- With string pooling disabled, each object's string literals form a local
  band. Code/string address pairs are useful boundary evidence where enough
  literals survive.

## Global ownership

Globals referenced by several units are declared in `include/globals.h`.
Compilation-unit-private declarations stay in their owner. Definitions move
out of `src/globals.c` only when both owner and declaration order are supported
by the original image.

`bin/collectGlobalDefinitions.py` produces `out/globals-audit.c` so verification
can inspect distributed definitions as one manifest. Use `make globals-data`
before and after moving a global band.

## Recovering another boundary

1. Run `make order` and inspect adjacent entries in `src/map`.
2. Compare callers, private globals, strings, and cross-release symbol order.
3. Do not promote a boundary based on subsystem similarity alone.
4. Update this file and `SRCS_ORDERED_CORE` together once the evidence is
   sufficient.

A wrong object boundary shifts every later rebuilt address, so uncertain edges
remain explicitly provisional.
